# Plainpad 
Plainpad is a simple notepad that is built with Python. Tkinter used to provide a simple gui that makes it a bit easier to work with Plainpad. All notes are saved as a csv file. Since I don't know much about OOP, gui side is dirty-coded. Cleaner code will be applied as soon as I learn OOP.
## Installation
You need to install [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) module from PyPi.
```
pip install pandas
```
## Usage 
Navigate to the folder that contains Plainpad. Simply run Plainpad by typing `python plainpad_gui.py`.
